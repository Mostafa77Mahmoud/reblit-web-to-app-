# Expo Integration Guide

## Current Setup
Your app is already running as a web application on Replit. To make it Expo-compatible:

## Step 1: Initialize Expo (when ready)
```bash
npx create-expo-app --template
```

## Step 2: Required Expo Dependencies
```json
{
  "expo-camera": "~13.4.4",
  "expo-image-picker": "~14.3.2",
  "expo-file-system": "~15.4.5",
  "@react-native-async-storage/async-storage": "1.18.2",
  "react-native-reanimated": "~3.3.0"
}
```

## Step 3: Key Changes for Native
- Replace `localStorage` with `AsyncStorage`
- Use `expo-camera` instead of web camera API
- Update navigation to use `@react-navigation/native`
- Replace CSS animations with `react-native-reanimated`

## Current Web App Features âœ…
- Mobile-responsive design
- Touch gestures and swipe navigation
- PWA capabilities
- Camera integration (web)
- Local storage
- Arabic/English RTL support
